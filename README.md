Pyhop is a simple HTN planner written in Python. 
It works in both Python 2.7 and 3.2. 

Pyhop was easy to implement (less than 150 lines of code), and if you understand the basic ideas of HTN planning ([this presentation](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nau/papers/nau2013game.pdf) contains a quick summary),
Pyhop should be easy to understand.

Pyhop's planning algorithm is like the one in [SHOP](http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/shop/), but with these differences:

  1. States of the world are represented using ordinary variable bindings, not logical propositions. A state is just a Python object that contains the variable bindings.  For example, to say that vehicle <code>v</code> is at location <code>d</code> in state <code>s</code>, you might write <br>
  <code>Â s.loc['v'] = 'd' </code>
  - HTN operators and methods aren't written in a specialized language. Instead, they're ordinary Python functions. The current state (e.g., <code>s</code> in the above example) is passed to them as an argument.
  - Unlike SHOP, Pyhop doesn't do Horn-clause inference in the preconditions of the HTN methods and operators. It's easier to write the tests directly in Python.
